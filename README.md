# citibike_system

This project does an examination using citibike ridership data.  The primary realization of the project can be found at

but this repository describes the input data and holds the jupyter notebook used to prepare the data.

### input data

Input was downloaded from https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data.  I chose the data for June-August, 2017; December, 2017; January - February, 2018; and June-August, 2018.

The data was pre-processed through the notebook data_manipulation.ipynb in order to add a few additional fields, discard certain outlier data, and combine it into seasonal files.
